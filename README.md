# Wallpaper Paradise APP

Wallpaper paradise is a platform for sharing and downloading wallpapers from my own [Wallpaper Paradise API](https://github.com/xXDeonoXx/wallpaper-paradise-api), the quirk of this APP is that i created my own React Native Package with native code to handle the android [wallpaper manager](https://github.com/xXDeonoXx/rn-manage-wallpaper) and use it.

- [x] List wallpapers from my api
